## Ordering the PCB 

An individual PCB can be ordered from [Tuc's Workbench](https://shop.tucs-workbench.com/products/trs-80-model-i-revision-k)

If you want to get manufactured yourself. Either PCBWAY or JLCPCB can be used, and specific output files have been generated for each supplier.

For JLCPCB The following notes apply when ordering
* tbd

For PCBWAY the following notes apply when ordering

## Ordering Parts

### Digikey

The Bill of Materials has been constructed primarily from parts provided by DigiKey.
If ordering from other parts suppliers then alternatives may need to be substituted

## Bill of Materials

The BOM contains the following important fields
* Reference - Used to identify component in Schematic / PCB
* MF - The name of the manufacturer of the part
* MP - The manufacturers part number
* Qty - Quantity

### Hard to Find

The following components are Included in the BOM but are considered obsolete/hard to find and may 
need to be sourced separately as mainstream suppliers don't necessarily hold them in stock.
See the [Parts Guide](PARTS_GUIDE.md) for further info on suitable replacements and where they may be ordered:
* The main Z80 CPU
* Video Memory Chip(s)
* 10.6445 Mhz Crystal Oscillator

### Component Choice

The board offers several choices on several connectors between a primary modern 
vs optional traditional part.  Noting the BOM **includes** the primary component, 
so if you intend to use the optional component you need to source it separately, 
and **remove the primary component** from the BOM prior to ordering

* Modern Power Switch (SW1) -> vs optional traditional locking pushbutton (S1) 
* Modern Reset Button (SW2) -> vs optional traditional pushbutton (S2)
* Video Output 5 Pin DIN" Connector (2) -> vs optional RCA connector (J12)

### Optional Components

IC Sockets are not included in the BOM. While optional, they are highly recommended for all IC's, 
and should be considered mandatory for all large scale components, e.g. CPU,
RAM (including Video RAM), and ROM (including Character Generator). 

IC sockets typically come in two types, traditional with square/flat holes, and the newer rounded
machine pins. In my experience I have found the traditional square sockets to be more forgiving
and are probably better for the larger IC's.

Several optional Pin Headers have not been included in the BOM as
they are not necessary in a standard configuration, and can be added at a latter date

For V2 of the board an optional onboard Audio Amplifier Module and Speaker can be 
installed. This requires specific sourcing and mounting and thus excluded from the BOM.
See Parts Guide for more information

## Also Required

This project only includes the components to produce the mainboard, you also need:

* Power Supply - A 5V regulated power supply with barrel jack (centre positive).
* Keyboard - A TRS-80 Model 1 keyboard with 20 pin connector  
* Monitor -  A monitor capable of displaying NTSC (or PAL) composite, non interlaced, monochrome video. Options:
  * An original TRS-80 Model 1 monitor, or compatible CRT monitor
  * Alternately many modern LCD monitors / TV's do support a composite input
  * Or an external converter that converts to modern standard e.g. RGB2HDMI
* Case - A standard TRS-80 Model 1 case is required
