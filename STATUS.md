## Status

Curenltly this board has been built, and functions. It start's and reports 48KB of ram,
I can type and run a basic program. Cassette interface is untestd however alligns to the original circuit design.
Extensive testing has not been done at this sage. Have not tested 3.5 Mhz double speed

There are some small know issue in the board, which have simple corrective items.
This is discussed in the builders guide

## Future

I will likely extend this mainboard some of the items I have in mind are:
* Video snow removal by prioritising Video over CPU access to Video ram
* Onboard Audio amplifier, with speaker output
* Alpha Joystick Port

Lower Priority:
* Model 3 support by remapping (GAL) IO devices...
* Inclusion of flexible memory mapping (GAL) to support CP/M...

Before this I want to get FreHD up and running.
